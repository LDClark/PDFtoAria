# PDFtoAria

An executable script that uses Oncology Services and Eclipse Scripting APIs to upload a PDF file into Aria.

An Oncology Services API key is available at my.varian.com.  The API key must be uploaded into the Varian Service Portal.  If running on a test box, Aria must have the Oncology Services package installed (must be able to access Documents workspace).  Must also edit the app.config file values to be site specific.

Uses code contributed by Matt Schmidt (https://github.com/mattcschmidt) and work from WUSTL (https://github.com/WUSTL-ClinicalDev).  Also references work in the my.Varian webinar from 23-3-2020 (https://github.com/VarianAPIs/Varian-Code-Samples).  Many thanks for your help!
